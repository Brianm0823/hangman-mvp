# hangman-mvp
Very basic hangman game. (Minimum Viable Product)
If I were to expand on this, I would use pygame to create a fully user interactable version
with graphics and buttons. Also would use an api that allows me to generate a random word from the english dictionary.
Current version is just enough logic to play the game using cli.

## Requirements
Python 3
